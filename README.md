### Ahoy! ğŸ‘‹

#### I write code for the United States Space Force under Kobayashi Maru.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a full-stack developer.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Rust by expanding on Rocket's [pastebin app](https://github.com/ananaso/rocket-pastebin) and am continuing to improve on my German language skills.
