### Ahoy! ðŸ‘‹

#### I write code for USSF under Kobayashi Maru's Section 31, but am transitioning to private industry in Aug 2024.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a software engineering SkillBridge intern for [Sagely](https://www.growsagely.com/), helping develop a new platform for guiding folks in their learning journeys.

ðŸŒ± I'm creating a [personal website](https://github.com/ananaso/adavidson.us) both to host my content and continue to grow my web development skills.

âš¡ In my free time I like to do road cycling, I'm continuing to improve my German skills, I'm dabbling in Scottish Gaelic, and I've started toying around with self-hosting.
