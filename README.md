### Ahoy! ğŸ‘‹

#### I sometimes write code and like to dream about doing it at work someday.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [GM writeups for a D&D Campaign](https://github.com/ananaso/GMNotes_CurseOfStrahd)

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m brushing up on the basics of writing and deploying javascript-based fullstack applications to prep for a job-related certification.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with reaching a conversational level in German
