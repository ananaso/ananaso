### Ahoy! 👋

#### I write code for USSF under Kobayashi Maru's Section 31, but am transitioning to private industry in Aug 2024.

🔭 I’m currently working as a full-stack developer, creating solutions for space command and control.

🤝 I’m collaborating with [@justinthelaw](https://github.com/justinthelaw) to create [Opera](https://github.com/justinthelaw/opera), a fork of [pdf-bullets](https://github.com/AF-VCD/pdf-bullets), where I am refactoring and preparing the frontend to incorporate the new features.

🌱 In my free time I'm continuing to improve my German skills, I'm dabbling in Esperanto, I've started toying around with self-hosting, and I've recently gotten into road cycling.
