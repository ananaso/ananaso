### Ahoy! ğŸ‘‹

#### I sometimes write code and like to dream about doing it at work someday.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently tesing for a job-related certification in javascript-based fullstack application development and [using LaTeX to plan and record a D&D campaign](https://github.com/ananaso/GMNotes_CurseOfStrahd)

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Rust by writing a [budgeting app](https://github.com/ananaso/rusty_budget) and always trying to improve my German language skills.
